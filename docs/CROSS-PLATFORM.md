# Silo — Cross-platform support (Windows / macOS / Linux)

Silo targets all three desktop OSes. Tauri builds native binaries for each; the
hard part isn't the runtime, it's **finding the game's files** and **projecting the
active set** correctly per platform. Items marked (?) need on-device verification
before we hardcode them.

## Where FS25 lives, per platform

FS25 officially ships on **Windows** and **macOS** (GIANTS). There is **no native
Linux build** — Linux players run the Windows build via **Steam Proton**, so on
Linux the game's files live inside a Proton prefix. Silo itself runs natively on
Linux and reaches into that prefix.

### User data dir (mods, savegames, gameSettings.xml)
| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2025\` |
| macOS (?) | `~/Library/Application Support/FarmingSimulator2025/` |
| Linux/Proton (?) | `<prefix>/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/FarmingSimulator2025/` where `<prefix>` = `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/<APPID>/pfx` |

### Game install dir (SDK schemas, pdlc)
| OS | Path (Steam) |
|----|------|
| Windows | `<lib>\steamapps\common\Farming Simulator 25\` |
| macOS (?) | `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Farming Simulator 25/` |
| Linux (?) | `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Farming Simulator 25/` |

`<lib>` is any Steam **library root** — games can live on other drives.

## Store / launcher discovery (don't hardcode drives)

FS25 is sold via **Steam**, **Epic**, and the **GIANTS** launcher. Detect, don't guess:

- **Steam:** parse `steamapps/libraryfolders.vdf` to enumerate all library roots,
  then look for the FS25 app (Steam AppID **2300320** (?) — verify) under each
  `common/`. libraryfolders.vdf locations:
  - Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\libraryfolders.vdf`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/libraryfolders.vdf`
  - Linux: `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/libraryfolders.vdf` (or `~/.local/share/Steam/…`)
- **Epic (?):** `%ProgramData%\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests\*.item` (JSON)
  lists install locations.
- **GIANTS launcher (?):** its own install path + registry entry on Windows.
- **Always allow manual override** — the user points Silo at the folder; detection
  is a convenience, never a hard dependency. `gameSettings.xml`'s
  `<modsDirectoryOverride>` can also redirect the mods folder anywhere.

## Projection strategy per OS (the delicate part)

Goal: make the game's flat `mods/` folder show exactly the active profile, without
mutating library originals, fully reversibly. Capability differs by OS:

| OS | Dir link | File link (.zip mods) | Notes |
|----|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Windows | **junction** — no admin needed | **symlink** — needs Developer Mode or admin | hardlink works same-volume only; **copy** is the universal fallback |
| macOS | symlink — no privilege | symlink — no privilege | straightforward |
| Linux | symlink — no privilege | symlink — no privilege | if projecting into a Proton prefix, keep paths inside the prefix drive |

**Rules:**
1. Probe link capability per game-root **once** (create+delete a test link). Record
   the mode; surface it to the user ("Linked" vs "Copied").
2. `.zip` mods are the risky case on Windows (file symlink). If file symlinks
   aren't permitted, fall back to **copy** for zips (junctions still handle unpacked
   dirs). Copy-mode must be first-class, not a footnote.
3. Track every link/copy Silo creates (tag/manifest) so cleanup only ever removes
   **Silo-owned** entries — never a user's real file.
4. Cross-volume: hardlinks and some symlinks fail across drives → copy-mode.

## Path / filesystem hygiene (all platforms)

- **Use Rust `PathBuf`** everywhere; never string-concatenate separators.
- **Linux is case-sensitive.** Mod tech names and `modDesc.xml` internal paths must
  be matched with real case; don't lowercase paths for comparison (lowercase only a
  *copy* for search/index keys).
- Normalize the digit-prefix rule and reserved-name checks per OS.
- Long paths on Windows (>260) — use extended-length prefixes / `dunce` if needed.

## Silo's own app-data location (via Tauri path API)

| OS | Config / data |
|----|------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Silo\` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Silo/` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Silo/` + `~/.local/share/Silo/` |

Never write Silo's DB/cache into the game folder. The game folder only ever
receives projected links/copies.

## Build & CI

- Tauri v2 cross-compiles per target: `.msi`/`.exe` (Win), `.dmg`/`.app` (mac,
  signed+notarized eventually), `.AppImage`/`.deb`/`.rpm` (Linux).
- GitHub Actions matrix: `windows-latest`, `macos-latest` (arm64 + x64),
  `ubuntu-latest`. (The incumbent's CI was a tangle of Mac-build hacks — keep ours
  a clean matrix.)

## Verification checklist (do on-device before shipping detection)
- [ ] Confirm FS25 Steam AppID and macOS user-dir path on a Mac.
- [ ] Confirm Proton prefix layout + compatdata AppID on a Linux box.
- [ ] Confirm Epic + GIANTS-launcher install manifests.
- [ ] Test file-symlink projection on Windows without Developer Mode (expect
      fallback to copy).
