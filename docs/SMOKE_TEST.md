# Silo — Smoke-Test Checklist (release gate)

Run top-to-bottom in the built app before tagging a release. Each item: **do → expect**.
Tags: `[app]` app-only · `[game]` needs FS25 (and often a loaded save) · `[net]` needs the
SiloAPI catalog reachable. "Auto-verified" = the logic/data path is covered by Rust unit
tests / `svelte-check` in CI; the box here is the *human* GUI/behaviour check that code
can't do.

Launch for testing: from `Silo/`, `npm run tauri:dev` (leave the terminal open — closing it
closes the app). A packaged build is `npm run tauri:build`.

> **Revised for v0.1.1.** The entire frontend was refactored into focused
> components/panels — so **re-run every section**: a change that compiles and builds can
> still have a runtime wiring regression. Two earlier bugs should now pass on re-check:
> §6 Browse thumbnails (were blank — CSP fix) and §10 Bindings map (stuck on "Reading…" —
> dedup fix). Plus the new **§14 Security & reliability** checks below.

---

## 0. Launch & shell
- [x] `[app]` App launches, no error dialog, window renders the Library view.
- [x] `[app]` Library/Browse tabs switch cleanly; theme toggle (Settings) cycles system/light/dark and both themes are legible.
- [x] `[app]` Resize the window — no horizontal scroll, panels stay centered.

## 1. Library scan & organize  _(auto-verified: scan/organize/moddesc engines)_
- [x] `[app]` Initial scan lists the full library; counts (mods/maps/scripts/DLC) look right; "scanned in N ms" shows.
- [x] `[app]` Rescan re-reads without error; warm scan is fast.
- [x] `[app]` Organize moves loose zips into `mods/archive/<Category>/`; dev **folder** mods are left untouched (zip-only).
- [ ] `[app]` **Organize preview**: clicking **Organize N** (auto-file OFF) opens a dry-run preview grouping the planned moves by category **before** anything moves; **Cancel** touches nothing; **Organize N** applies it. Ticking **"Don't preview next time"** and confirming makes the next Organize skip straight to applying (clear `localStorage silo.organizePreviewSkip` to re-enable).
- [x] `[app]` Category rail filters; search filters by title/author/tech name; Favorites/Hidden toggles work.
- [x] `[app]` Select-all checkbox activates/deactivates the filtered set.

## 2. Curation & detail drawer  _(auto-verified: curation/tags/rating store)_
- [x] `[app]` Click a mod row → detail drawer opens with icon, metadata, deps (with present/missing status).
- [x] `[app]` Favorite / Broken / Hidden toggles persist across a rescan; star rating persists; tags add/remove & filter; notes save on blur.
- [ ] `[app]` **Integrity verification**: in a mod's detail drawer, **Verify integrity** returns one of **Verified** (a GitHub-source mod SiloAPI has hashed, e.g. `FS25_CabView`), **Modified** (edit a file inside a verified mod's zip → expect the changed file listed), or **Unverified** (a ModHub-only-latest or unknown mod — correct, not a bug). Folder mods show "can't be verified". No red console errors.
- [ ] `[app]` **Last run** section shows this mod's log health (see §8) — errors/cosmetic/clean.
- [ ] `[net]` **Catalog** section shows latest version / "update available (source)" / "not in catalog".
- [ ] `[app]` Reveal opens the file in Explorer; activate/deactivate toggles the active dot.

## 3. Loadouts & savegames  _(auto-verified: loadout/savegame parse)_
- [ ] `[app]` Save current active set as a loadout; apply/overwrite/delete; active loadout name shows in the toolbar.
- [ ] `[app]` Export a loadout to `.silo`, re-import it as a new loadout.
- [ ] `[game]` Savegames panel lists real saves with map + mod list; "→ Loadout" builds a loadout from a save's mods (warns on missing).
- [ ] `[app]` Savegame backup copies to `SiloBackups/`.

## 4. Conflicts  _(auto-verified: conflict engine incl. map + fillType)_
- [ ] `[app]` Conflicts stat shows count; panel lists uniqueType / specialization / script collisions with severity + involved mods.
- [ ] `[app]` **Duplicate-map**: enable 2+ maps → a critical "N maps enabled" conflict appears; drop to one → it clears.
- [ ] `[app]` **fillType override**: if two active mods declare the same `<fillType name>`, a warning appears naming both; distinct filltypes do NOT flag.

## 5. Health & launch
- [ ] `[app]` "Need attention" panel: missing deps, corrupt mods, digit-prefix names.
- [ ] `[game]` Launch button starts FS25 (Steam) with the active set projected.

## 6. Browse (catalog)  _(auto-verified: adapters, /mods shape)_
- [ ] `[net]` Browse loads the catalog; header shows total; **scroll works** (regression-fixed).
- [ ] `[net]` Search filters; category dropdown filters; "Load more" pages to the end ("That's all N").
- [ ] `[net]` Per-source buttons render with versions: GitHub = ⬇ (install), ModHub/Nexus = ↗ (open page). "In library" badge on owned mods.
- [ ] `[net][game]` Install a GitHub mod → progress bar advances (MB), lands in the library on rescan, then loads in-game.
- [ ] `[net]` Details opens the drawer: cover image, facts, full source list with per-source versions + open-page links.

## 7. Updates
- [ ] `[net]` "⟳ Updates" checks the whole library via the catalog; rows show current→latest with source badge; Install works.
- [ ] `[net]` Detail-drawer GitHub link: paste owner/repo (or accept the auto-suggestion), Check, Install — backs up `.bak`.

## 8. Crash & log triage  _(auto-verified: log parser on real 713-mod log)_
- [ ] `[app]` "◆ diagnose" → verdict banner: healthy / crashed / errors-worth-a-look, matching your last run.
- [ ] `[app]` Culprit mods ranked; cosmetic-only mods behind the "safe to ignore" disclosure; unattributed count + Open log.txt.
- [ ] `[app]` Re-read log after a new FS25 run updates the report.

## 9. Guided bisection  _(auto-verified: stepper convergence 1..64)_
- [ ] `[app]` From triage (crash, no culprit) or the footer link → intro shows suspect count + ~launches.
- [ ] `[game]` Full loop: Start → Silo applies half → Launch FS25 → reproduce → quit → "still broken?" (crash auto-detected) → narrows → repeats → names a culprit (or "interaction").
- [ ] `[app]` Finish/cancel restores your original active set exactly.
- [ ] `[app]` **Crash-safety**: start a bisection, force-quit Silo mid-run, relaunch → recovery banner offers to restore your set; Restore works.

## 10. Bindings map  _(auto-verified: parser on real inputBinding.xml)_
- [ ] `[app]` "⌨ bindings" lists devices; every action↔key shown; search filters; "inputs bound to more than one action" section highlights reuse (as review, not error).

## 11. Multiplayer sync  _(auto-verified: manifest diff + md5 vs md5sum)_
- [ ] `[app]` "Multiplayer" → Export active set → saves a `.silomp`.
- [ ] `[app]` Round-trip: Verify against your own just-exported manifest → "your set matches."
- [ ] `[app]` Negative: deactivate a mod, re-verify the same manifest → it shows under "get these" (and reactivating clears it). Change a version → "wrong version". An extra active mod → "turn these off".

## 12. Filltype bridge  _(auto-verified: generator XML vs real mods)_
- [ ] `[app]` "⛓ bridge" → enter a filltype name, pick categories, Generate → `.zip` appears in mods folder + rescan; it shows in the library.
- [ ] `[game]` **The real test**: enable the bridge + the map, load a save → the filltype now works with the checked equipment (haul/store/sell). If off, delete the zip (reversible).

## 13. Config editors & diagnostics  _(auto-verified: xmlconfig/settings_form)_
- [ ] `[game]` game.xml graphics editor: apply a preset, relaunch → setting took; `.bak` written.
- [ ] `[game]` Savegame config editor: change difficulty/growth etc., load save → applied; `.bak` written.
- [ ] `[app]` Per-mod settings form (for a mod that has settings) edits + saves with `.bak`; raw-XML fallback works.
- [ ] `[app]` Diagnostics report exports a markdown summary.

---

## 14. Security & reliability (v0.1.1 hardening)
- [ ] `[app]` **Token in the OS keychain.** Connect GitHub (Settings) and, if you have a key, Nexus. Then check the OS credential store — Windows: `Credential Manager → Windows Credentials`, look for `com.hllmr.silo`; macOS: Keychain Access, search "Silo". The token should appear there. It should NOT be readable in the app's `silo.db` (it lives in `app_data_dir`).
- [ ] `[app]` **Token persists + still works.** Restart the app: still "Connected as …", and a source action (⭐ Star / 👍 Endorse) still works.
- [ ] `[app]` **Disconnect clears it.** Disconnect GitHub → the `com.hllmr.silo`/`gh_token` entry is gone from the credential store.
- [ ] `[net]` **Corrupt-update guard.** (If practical) point an update at a truncated/non-zip file → it errors ("not a valid .zip archive") and does NOT replace the existing mod; a `.zip.bak` is only written when a real overwrite happens.
- [ ] `[app]` **Organize is non-destructive.** After an Organize + Flatten round-trip, no mod files are missing (count returns to baseline). If Silo reports "kept an unrecognized file in archive/", it did NOT delete it — that's the safety guard working.
- [ ] `[app]` **User replacements are never deleted.** Organize a mod, deactivate it (parked), then manually drop a *different* file with the same name into the flat `mods/` folder. Re-activate then deactivate (or Flatten): Silo must **leave your file untouched** and report "isn't the one Silo projected", never delete it.
- [ ] `[app]` **Scans stay fast + safe.** A full rescan of the large library completes without error (zip-read caps don't reject normal mods).

## 15. Full UI coverage sweep — open every panel, drawer, toggle, modal

The frontend was split into ~20 new components, so this section exists to **touch every
interactive surface at least once** and catch a wiring regression that compiles fine.
For each item: it **opens/toggles without error, renders its content, and closes cleanly**
(via its ✕, the backdrop, or Esc), and re-opening works. **Keep the devtools console open
(if available) and confirm no red errors appear** as you open/close each — a broken prop
or `$effect` in an extracted component shows up there first. None of these should cover the
top header bar (the drawer/backdrop must start below it).

**Top bar (always visible):**
- [ ] `[app]` Library ↔ Browse tabs switch; switching **closes an open detail drawer** (no overlap).
- [ ] `[app]` **Savegames** button opens the Savegames panel; closes.
- [ ] `[app]` **Loadouts** button opens the Loadouts panel; closes.
- [ ] `[app]` **Multiplayer** button opens the MP-sync panel; closes.
- [ ] `[net]` **Updates** (⟳) opens the Updates panel; closes.
- [ ] `[app]` **Rescan** runs a scan (spinner → counts refresh).
- [ ] `[app]` **Settings** (gear) opens; closes.
- [ ] `[game]` **Launch** is present (don't have to run it here).

**Library stat/filter bar:**
- [ ] `[app]` **mods** tile opens the library **Stats** panel; closes.
- [ ] `[app]` **conflicts** tile opens the **Conflicts** panel; closes.
- [ ] `[app]` **need attention** tile opens the **Health** panel; closes.
- [ ] `[app]` **◆ diagnose** opens Crash/Log triage; **⌨ bindings** opens the bindings map; **⛓ bridge** opens the bridge tool. Each closes.
- [ ] `[app]` Filter toggles each flip and re-filter the list: **Favorites**, **Hidden**, **⚑ Flagged**, **⚠ In conflict** (disabled when 0). Combine two, then clear.
- [ ] `[app]` **Search** box filters live; clearing restores the list.

**Library toolbar + rail:**
- [ ] `[app]` **Category rail**: click a category and a subcategory → list narrows; "All mods" resets.
- [ ] `[app]` **Right-click a category** → context menu appears and dismisses.
- [ ] `[app]` **Sort** dropdown cycles Name / Category / Size / Recently added / Version / **My rating**; the **↑/↓** direction button flips order.
- [ ] `[app]` **Select-all** checkbox activates/deactivates the filtered set (indeterminate state renders when partial).

**Library detail drawer (click a mod row) — every sub-section:**
- [ ] `[app]` Header (icon/title/author/version/tech name) + **✕ closes**; **drag the left edge to resize** (persists); backdrop click closes.
- [ ] `[app]` Action buttons all respond: **Active/Parked**, **Favorite**, **Broken**, **Hidden**, **Reveal**, and **Settings** (only when the mod has settings).
- [ ] `[app]` **Category editor**: change the dropdown/subcategory → **Save** enables; **Reset to auto** shows for an overridden mod.
- [ ] `[app]` **Last run** + **Catalog** status render (the `ModStatus` component).
- [ ] `[app]` **Rating / tags / notes** (the `ModCuration` component): set a star, add + remove a tag, type a note (saves on blur).
- [ ] `[net]` **GitHub link** (`ModRepoLink`): the owner/repo field, Check, and Install controls render.
- [ ] `[app]` **Dependencies**, **uniqueType**, and **Conflicts** sub-sections render when present.

**Settings panel — every control:**
- [ ] `[app]` **Theme** System/Light/Dark switch (both themes legible).
- [ ] `[app]` **GitHub account**: Connect / **Enable actions** / **Use a Personal Access Token** / Disconnect all render (see §14 for the real connect).
- [ ] `[app]` **Nexus account**: Connect (API key) / Disconnect render.
- [ ] `[app]` **Library layout**: **Organize**, **Rebuild categories**, **Restore vanilla**, and the **auto-file toggle** are present. Confirm auto-file is **OFF by default** on a fresh profile.

**Browse tab — every surface:**
- [ ] `[net]` **Sort** dropdown (Popular / Most downloaded / Top rated / Newest / Name) and **category** dropdown both re-query.
- [ ] `[net]` A **card** shows title/author/rating/downloads badges + per-source chips; **Details** opens the Browse drawer.
- [ ] `[net]` **Browse drawer**: facts, the full **Available from** source list, and the **Interact** cards render — **GitHub** (★/⑂/👁/◎ + Star/Watch), **Nexus** (👍 + Endorse), **ModHub** (⭐ + Rate ↗).
- [ ] `[net]` **Read more** opens the **description modal** (full body + "Open full mod page"); closes.

**Every remaining modal opens + closes cleanly:**
- [ ] `[app]` Crash triage · Guided bisection intro · Bindings map · Multiplayer sync · Filltype bridge · Savegame config editor · Per-mod settings form · Updates · Diagnostics "Export report".

## Sign-off
- [ ] All `[app]` items pass.
- [ ] All `[game]`/`[net]` items pass (or known-limitations noted below).
- [ ] `npm run tauri:build` produces a launchable packaged app.

**Known limitations to note at release:** ModHub/Nexus are index-only (open-page, no direct
install — GIANTS/Nexus gate downloads); ghost-keybind cleanup deferred (unverified premise);
override-conflict detection is fillTypes-only for now.
