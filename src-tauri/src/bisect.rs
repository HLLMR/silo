//! Guided bisection — the automated version of the community's manual "disable half,
//! relaunch, repeat" ritual for finding which mod (or interaction) breaks the game when
//! the log can't name a culprit outright.
//!
//! Pure logic only: given the suspect pool still in play, decide the next split. The
//! frontend drives the side effects each round — project the test half (existing
//! hardlink set_active), launch, read the verdict (a crash auto-detected from the log's
//! missing clean-exit marker, or the user's answer for "loads but still broken") — then
//! narrows the pool by that verdict and asks for the next step.
//!
//! Invariant: the culprit is always somewhere in `pool`. Testing the first half with the
//! second half DISABLED means "still broken" => culprit in the tested half; "fixed" =>
//! culprit in the other half. Down to one mod, that's the culprit. If it narrows to
//! nothing (or the single-mod check clears), the cause is an interaction, not one mod —
//! reported honestly rather than pinned on an innocent.
