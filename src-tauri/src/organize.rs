//! The organize / projection engine — the only code that writes to the game's mods
//! folder. Model (chosen by the user):
//!
//! * **At rest:** every mod is moved into `mods/archive/<Category>/` (subfolders the
//!   game ignores, since it only reads the flat root).
//! * **Active:** the chosen set is projected back into the flat root as **hardlinks**
//!   (zips) or dir links (unpacked mods) — same volume as the archive, so no admin /
//!   Developer Mode and no disk duplication. The game reads the flat root and loads
//!   exactly the active set.
//! * **Flatten:** everything moves back to a vanilla flat `mods/`; only *empty* archive
//!   directories are removed. Anything Silo doesn't recognize is left in place, never
//!   deleted — always one step from stock, and never a step that eats a file.
//!
//! Every move/link is recorded in the `organized` manifest so cleanup only ever
//! touches Silo-owned entries; nothing the user placed is deleted. Failures are
//! collected and reported, not panicked on.
