# Security Policy

Silo is a native desktop app that manages your Farming Simulator 25 mod library.
We take its security seriously — it reads and writes files on your machine and
talks to a handful of network services, so we want to hear about anything that
could put users at risk.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for a security vulnerability.**

1. **Preferred:** use GitHub's
   [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/HLLMR/silo/security/advisories/new)
   on `HLLMR/silo` (Security → Report a vulnerability). This keeps the report
   private between you and the maintainers until a fix is out.
2. **If you can't use that**, open a minimal public issue on
   [HLLMR/silo](https://github.com/HLLMR/silo/issues) that says only that you've
   found a security problem and asks for a private channel — **without** the
   details, proof-of-concept, or anything that would let others exploit it. A
   maintainer will get you somewhere private to share the specifics.

Please include, when you can: the Silo version, your OS, what the issue is, and
the steps or a proof-of-concept to reproduce it. We'll acknowledge your report,
keep you updated on the fix, and credit you when it ships (unless you'd rather
stay anonymous).

## Scope

**In scope** — the Silo desktop application in this repository:

- The Rust core (`src-tauri/`) and the Svelte frontend (`src/`).
- Local file handling: library scanning, projection (symlink/junction/copy),
  savegame backups, and any write into
  `Documents/My Games/FarmingSimulator2025/`. Path traversal, unsafe extraction,
  or a non-reversible write that could damage a user's game files are all
  in-scope concerns.
- Silo's outbound network calls. Silo talks to:
  - **`silo-api.hllmr.com`** — the SiloAPI catalog backend, for cross-source mod
    metadata.
  - **GitHub, Nexus, and ModHub** — reached **through the user's own accounts
    and credentials** (e.g. an OAuth token to star a GitHub repo, or endorse on
    Nexus). Silo brokers the action; it does not hold or proxy your credentials
    on any server of ours.

**Generally out of scope:**

- Vulnerabilities in FS25 itself, GIANTS software, GitHub, Nexus, or ModHub —
  report those to the respective vendor. (A flaw in how *Silo* interacts with
  them is in scope.)
- Issues that require a machine already compromised by a local attacker, or that
  depend on a malicious mod the user chose to install and run in the game.
- The SiloAPI server itself lives in a separate repository
  (`HLLMR/silo-api`) — report server-side issues there, but if you're unsure,
  send it here and we'll route it.

## Privacy posture: no telemetry, no account

Silo has **no analytics, no telemetry, and no account system** — there is
nothing to sign up for and nothing phones home about your usage. Its only
outbound traffic is the catalog lookups to `silo-api.hllmr.com` and the
per-source actions you explicitly trigger through your own GitHub / Nexus /
ModHub credentials. This is intentional and part of the app's trust model; a
change that quietly adds tracking or exfiltrates data would itself be treated as
a security issue.

## Supported versions

Silo is in public beta. Security fixes land on `main` and ship in the next
release. Please test against the latest release or a current build from source
before reporting.
